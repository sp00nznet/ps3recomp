/*
 * ps3recomp - PPU <-> SPU lock-line coherence
 *
 * An SPU that issues GETLLAR holds a reservation on a 128-byte line and then
 * spins, waiting for someone else to change it. On real hardware a store by
 * ANY other processor to that line kills the reservation and raises
 * SPU_EVENT_LR on the reserving SPU, which is how a parked SPURS idle service
 * learns that the PPU has posted work. Emulated, the two halves live on
 * different host threads with nothing between them, so the SPU half alone gets
 * PUTLLC right (it compares the line before committing) while the PPU half
 * never tells anyone it wrote. The service sleeps through the signal.
 *
 * This is the missing half. Every line an SPU reserves is marked in a bitmap;
 * the PPU store paths (runtime/ppu/ppu_memory.h and runtime/ppu/ppu_loader.cpp)
 * check the bitmap, and on a hit commit the store under the same lock-line lock
 * the SPU's GETLLAR/PUTLLC transaction takes, then notify. That does two things
 * at once: the store can no longer land inside a PUTLLC's compare/commit window
 * (where it would be silently reverted), and the reserving SPU gets its event.
 *
 * The bitmap check is a shift and a load against a global that stays zero until
 * an SPU actually reserves something, so a title that never runs SPU code pays
 * one predictable branch per store.
