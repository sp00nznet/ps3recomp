 * the interrupt it raises -- land after the SPU has run on past the code that
 * armed it. We execute the list synchronously inside `wrch MFC_Cmd`, so the
 * interrupt was delivered before the job manager had stored
 * g_WwsJob_loadJobState = kReadCommands (LS 0x12A0).
 *
 * Its interrupt handler gates the Load->Run advance on BOTH the ch25 stall mask
 * carrying tag 0 (kLoadJob_readCommands) AND loadJobState == kReadCommands. With
 * the state still kNone it correctly declined to advance -- and because
 * MFC_RdListStallStat is "accumulative, clear on read" that single stall was
 * consumed, so no later interrupt could ever advance it: the job never ran and
 * LBP's loading thread deadlocked on a completion that never came.
 *
 * Holding the interrupt off for N drain ticks was tried and DISPROVEN: a probe
 * at the stall site shows loadJobState is ALREADY 0 when the GETLB is issued, so
 * the arming store never ran on this path at all -- it is not an interrupt-timing
 * race. (The pm takes trychangefreetoloadjob's early-exit `ceqhi jobHeader,1 /
 * brhz cond1,Exit` to LS 0x2D30, skipping the Load setup.) Default OFF; kept
 * env-gated for experiments: SPU_SN_DEFER=<n> ticks (0 = immediate, faithful
